       "- The model is considered fast, cost-effective, and available to most users, dominating the price-performance space compared to others.\n",
       "- OpenAI has worked on making GPT-5 more customizable and \"warmer\" in personality, acknowledging that no single model fits all user preferences.\n",
       "- However, some users find the upgrade underwhelming compared to competitors like Anthropic’s Claude 4/4.1 models, and GPT-5 still struggles with creative writing and some advanced reasoning challenges like ARC-AGI 2.\n",
       "- OpenAI provides different versions like GPT-5.2, GPT-5 mini, and GPT-5 nano to balance performance, speed, and cost efficiency.\n",
       "- There is ongoing emphasis on safety features and steerability to prevent misuse and improve user experience.\n",

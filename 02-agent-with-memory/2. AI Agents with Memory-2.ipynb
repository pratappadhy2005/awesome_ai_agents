       "- Day 2: Morning boat/snorkel trip (half-day) to see coral gardens and turtles or take a catamaran sail with snorkeling and lunch. Afternoon paddleboarding or relax by the pool. Evening cocktails and fresh seafood.\n",
       "- Day 3 (departure): Early beach stroll and quick souvenir stop, head to the airport.\n",

       "Where to stay (examples)\n",

       "- Transport: Taxis are common; renting a car gives more flexibility for short stays.\n",
       "- Health/safety: Use reef-safe sunscreen and bring snorkeling gear if you prefer your own.\n",
